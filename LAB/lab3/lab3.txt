The CPU management method is mult-processes also called concurrent which mean one cpu alternately runs processes by one special way which makes it seems to run many processes at one time.
The process has many different status to describe it, as NEW(N),READY(J),RUNNING(R),WAIT(W),EXIT(E) and so on. These five statuses are the most basic condition.
A executable file is started to be as a NEW process, and then come to J status which is in the queue of J processes. When it begins to run it becomes R status. If someone or system or itself gives the signal of wait, it will become W status.
E status is when one dynamic process becomes a static executable file or code. At the end of exiting, the process will sent an exit code to its father process.
The organization is PCB(Process Control Block), Status and Queue. The actual process is Opreation of Queue, Scheculing and Switching.


Note : printing R status needs to go before switch_to(next).
